# BEM View Components for Laravel

This package introduces a `BemComponent` class that you can use instead of the regular `Component` class, which gives you a few helper methods to aid you with your bem-style components.


## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require whitecube/bem-components
```

## Usage

```php
<?php

namespace App\View\Components;

use Whitecube\BemComponents\BemComponent;

class Btn extends BemComponent
{
    public $href;
    public $icon;

    /**
     * Create a new component instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct($href, $icon = null)
    {
        $this->href = $href;
        $this->icon = $icon;
    }

    /**
     * Get the view / contents that represent the component.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\View\View|string
     */
    public function render()
    {
        return view('components.btn');
    }

}

```

```blade
<a href="{{ $href }}" class="{{ $bem('btn') }}">
    @if($hasModifier('icon'))
        <span class="btn__icon" data-icon="{{ $icon }}"></span>
    @endif
    
    {{ $slot }}
</a>

```

Now you can pass modifiers as you please
```blade
<x-btn href="#" modifiers="error">Error</x-btn>
will result in 
<a href="#" class="btn btn--error">Error</a>

<x-btn href="#" modifiers="primary icon" icon="calendar">Calendar</x-btn>
will result in 
<a href="#" class="btn btn--primary btn--icon">
    <span class="btn__icon" data-icon="calendar"></span>
    Calendar
</a>
```

## Available methods

### `$bem($base): string`
Get the compiled bem classes with modifiers. The modifiers are specified using the `modifiers` prop on your component, which accepts either a string of space-separated modifiers, or an array.

For example, calling `$bem('btn')` on these:

```blade
<x-btn modifiers="primary error" />
<x-btn :modifiers="['primary', 'error']" />
```

Will output `btn btn--primary btn--error`

Any additional classes are also kept:

```blade
<x-btn modifiers="primary error" class="header__btn" />
```

Will output `header__btn btn btn--primary btn--error`

---

### `$hasModifier($modifier): bool`
Checks if the specified modifier is applied on this component.

---

### `$hasClass($class): bool`
Checks if the specified class is applied on this component.
